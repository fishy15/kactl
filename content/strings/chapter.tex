\subsection{Lyndon Enumeration}

\kactlimport{Duval.h}

$s$ is a Lyndon word $\iff$ $s$ is strictly smaller than all of its proper suffixes $\iff$ $s$ is strictly smaller than all of its nontrivial rotations

Lyndon factorization is the unique set of $s = w_1 + ... + w_k$ such that $w$ is non-increasing and each $w_i$ is a Lyndon word

$w_k$ is the smallest suffix of $s$ (different from smallest rotation)

\subsection{Run Enumeration}

A run is a tuple $(l, r, p)$ where $p$ is the (partial) period of $s[l, r]$ and $[l, r]$ is maximal

A string of length $n$ has at most $n$ runs

Sum of $(r - l) / p$ is at most $3n$

Number of two-repeats is at most $n \log n$
